    <p>Thank you for participating in our study! In this study, we will ask you to watch a video and then describe what you see.</p>

    <p>Each of the videos that you will see will have two actors. Your job is to write a single sentence giving a description of the video.</p>

    <h3>There are just two requirements:
        <ol>
        <li> Your writing should be a good description of the video.</li>
        <li> You should write only ONE English sentence that is well-formed.<br>
        One sentence means to use only one period in your writing.</li>
        </ol>
    </h3>

    <p>
    <ul>Examples of such one-sentence descriptions are:
        <li>The mother gave her boy some milk.</li>
        <li>A girl and a boy had dinner together.</li>
        <li>Some monkeys like to fight each other, but others don't.</li>
        <li>The doctor entered the room, but did not speak.</li>
        <li>Good students take great interest in their studies.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>The videos are a few seconds long each, and will not have sound. When you are finished reading these instructions, click the button below to continue.</p>
